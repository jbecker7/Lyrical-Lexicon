# Lyrical Lexicon

This is a Python Flask webapp allowing the user to search for artists and find the most common words used in their songs.

This is the next evolution of the [GFriend-Lyrics-Frequency](https://github.com/jbecker7/GFriend-Lyrics-Frequency) and [Girl-Group-Comparison](https://github.com/jbecker7/Girl-Group-Comparison) projects, using the same main function built with LyricsGenius.
